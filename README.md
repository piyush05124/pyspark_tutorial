## ðŸ“Œ What is Apache Spark?

[Apache Spark](https://spark.apache.org/) is an **open-source, distributed computing system** designed for **fast processing of large-scale data**. It provides a powerful engine for both **batch** and **streaming** data workloads using a simple programming interface.

Unlike traditional big data tools like Hadoop MapReduce, Spark stores intermediate data **in memory**, making it **much faster** for complex data pipelines and iterative algorithms.

## ðŸš€ Why Do We Need Spark?

### âœ… Key Benefits:

- **Fast**: In-memory computation makes Spark up to 100x faster than Hadoop MapReduce.
- **Unified Engine**: Supports SQL, machine learning (MLlib), graph processing (GraphX), and streaming in one platform.
- **Scalable**: Easily handles petabytes of data across a cluster of machines.
- **Flexible**: Supports Java, Scala, Python (PySpark), and R.
- **Big Data Friendly**: Integrates with HDFS, Hive, Cassandra, S3, and more.
